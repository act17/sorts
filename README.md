# sorts
A variety of sorting algorithms that I've programmed.
# General Preface
  The point of this repository is to publically show implementations of sorting algorithims that I've programmed.
# Special Thanks
  Massive thanks to the YouTube Channel *udiprod* (https://www.youtube.com/c/udiprod) who gave me the primary information on sorting algorithims altogether. Another thanks is to the users of the Ubuntu Hideout Discord *Beef Broccoli*, *b-fuze (Mike32)* and *Xen* for providing me help in actually developing the program - in spite of my anger and frustration. Finally, a special thanks to *Chris7*, who pointed out an obvious error in a ``for`` loop's initialization.
# Current Sorts
